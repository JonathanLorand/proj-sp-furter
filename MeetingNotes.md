  - 3 ideas of where to put the linear logic in the boolean profunctor picture
   -  put "in" the preorders, freely generate a linera logic picture in some sense
     - restricts class of preorders...
     - ![[Screen Shot 2021-03-09 at 15.56.12.png]]
   - linear logic structure in the category where one is putting the feasibility relations
     - i.e. relate R --> F to implication in linear logic
       - Boolean is compact closed, so linear logic already, but it is degenerate b/c compact closed (connectives coincide)
         - can one undifferentiate

   - look at possible linear logic structure on the internal arrows part from profunctors
     - replace Bool with a more interesting preorder structure and equip it with linear logic operations?
       - true / maybe / false ?
   - looking at the queries


 Reference: poset-valued sets

 coherence spaces, three element poset linearly ordered (no, maybe,  yes)

  - (co)presheaves -> look into
