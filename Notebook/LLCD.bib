abstract = {Considering resource usage is a powerful insight in the analysis of many phenomena in the sciences. Much of the current research on these resource theories focuses on the analysis of specific resources such quantum entanglement, purity, randomness or asymmetry. However, the mathematical foundations of resource theories are at a much earlier stage, and there has been no satisfactory account of quantitative aspects such as costs, rates or probabilities. We present a categorical foundation for quantitative resource theories, derived from enriched category theory. Our approach is compositional, with rich algebraic structure facilitating calculations. The resulting theory is parameterized, both in the quantities under consideration, for example costs or probabilities, and in the structural features of the resources such as whether they can be freely copied or deleted. We also achieve a clear separation of concerns between the resource conversions that are freely available, and the costly resources that are typically the object of study. By using an abstract categorical approach, our framework is naturally open to extension. We provide many examples throughout, emphasising the resource theoretic intuitions for each of the mathematical objects under consideration.},

abstract = {We describe a method for constructing models of linear logic based on the category of sets and relations. The resulting categories are non-degenerate in general; in particular they are not compact closed nor do they have biproducts. The construction is simple, lifting the structure of a poset to the new category. The underlying poset thus controls the structure of this category, and different posets give rise to differently-flavoured models. As a result, this technique allows the construction of models for both, intuitionistic or classical linear logic as desired. A number of well-known models, for example coherence spaces and hypercoherences, are instances of this method. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Yetter1990,
abstract = {It is the purpose of this paper to make explicit the connection between J.-Y. Girard's “linear logic” [4], and certain models for the logic of quantum mechanics, namely Mulvey's “quantales” [9]. This will be done not only in the case of commutative linear logic, but also in the case of a version of noncommutative linear logic suggested, but not fully formalized, by Girard in lectures given at McGill University in the fall of 1987 [5], and which for reasons which will become clear later we call “cyclic linear logic”.For many of our results on quantales, we rely on the work of Niefield and Rosenthal [10]. The reader should note that by “the logic of quantum mechanics” we do not mean the lattice theoretic “quantum logics” of Birkhoff and von Neumann [1], but rather a logic involving an associative (in general noncommutative) operation “and then”. Logical validity is intended to embody empirical verification (whether a physical experiment, or running a program), and the validity of A & B (in Mulvey's notation) is to be regarded as “we have verified A , and then we have verified B ”. (See M. D. Srinivas [11] for another exposition of this idea.) This of course is precisely the view of the “multiplicative conjunction”, ⊗, in the phase semantics for Girard's linear logic [4], [5]. Indeed the quantale semantics for linear logic may be regarded as an element-free version of the phase semantics.},
